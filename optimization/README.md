# Optimize LevelDB Options for Real-World Workload

## LevelDB options tuning contest for real-world workload
1. Study below db options and relationships between them.
2. Analyze workload such as key/value size, key/operations distribution.
3. Hypothesize best option set and verify it by experiment.
4. Submit best option set to assistant.
5. Write a document about your hypothesis, experiment and final decision.
6. Prepare 15-min presentation and upload your PPT in pdf format.
* Please refer to LevelDB options.h and RocksDB tunning guide before you start!

## LevelDB options and restrictions
``` c++
// ---------------------------Restriction----------------------------
// max_memory size (= write_buffer_size*2 + block_cache_size) <= 1GB
// max_file_size <= 1GB
// Do not change other options except below.


// -------------LevelDB Default Options, Tune them!------------------
// Memtable
size_t write_buffer_size = 4 * 1024 * 1024; 

// SST
size_t max_file_size = 2 * 1024 * 1024;
size_t block_size = 4 * 1024;
int block_restart_interval = 16;

// Compression
CompressionType compression = kSnappyCompression;

// BloomFiliter
const FilterPolicy* filter_policy = nullptr;

// Cache
Cache* block_cache = nullptr;
bool fill_cache = true;

## Day 1: YCSB
 The goal of the Yahoo Cloud Serving Benchmark (YCSB) project is to develop a framework and common set of workloads for evaluating the performance of different "key-value" and "cloud" serving stores.

#### Contest Workload
* load A -> run A -> run D -> run E
#### Criteria For Evaluation
* total execution time

## Day 2: Twitter Cache Trace
This repository describes the traces from Twitter's in-memory caching ([Twemcache](https://github.com/twitter/twemcache)/[Pelikan](https://github.com/twitter/pelikan)) clusters. The current traces were collected from 54 clusters in Mar 2020. The traces are one-week-long. 
More details are described in the following paper and blog.
